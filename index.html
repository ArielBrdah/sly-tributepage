  <li data-aos="fade-right">He earned his first role in a soft-core pornography film, â€˜The Party at Kitty and Studâ€™sâ€™, in 1970. Later in life, Stallone claimed that he did the film out of desperation, because he needed the money. The same year, he appeared in the movie, â€˜Rebelâ€™, which made him a national star.
  </li>
  <li data-aos="fade-right">
He also starred in the off-Broadway stage piece, â€˜Scoreâ€™, which ran for 23 performances in 1971. The same was later made into a film by Radley Metzger. He also appeared in Woody Allenâ€™s â€˜Bananasâ€™ and the thriller â€˜Kluteâ€™ as an extra.
    </li>
    <li data-aos="fade-right">
    In 1975, he was seen in the Jack Lemmon film, â€˜The Prisoner of Second Avenueâ€™ and he also played supporting roles in the films, â€˜Farewell, My Lovelyâ€™, â€˜Caponeâ€™ and â€˜Death Race 2000â€™.
    </li>
    <li data-aos="fade-right">
The year 1976 brought with it a lot of promise and hope for Stallone as he starred in his first breakthrough film, â€˜Rockyâ€™, an action-drama feature, for which he also wrote the script. The movie is considered one of his most commercially successful movies till date.
After swooning in the success of â€˜Rockyâ€™, he made his directorial debut in 1978 for the film, â€˜Paradise Alleyâ€™. The same year, he played a role in the film, â€˜F.I.S.Tâ€™, a film based on the life of James Hoffa.
In 1979, he wrote and starred in the sequel of â€˜Rockyâ€™ titled â€˜Rocky IIâ€™, which also went on to become a sleeper hit. Two years later, he starred in â€˜Escape to Victoryâ€™ and â€˜Nighthawksâ€™.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
After the success of â€˜Rockyâ€™, he launched another action venture, starring as the Vietnam War veteran, â€˜John Ramboâ€™ in the film, â€˜First Bloodâ€™ in 1982. This went on to become both a critical and profitable hit at the box-office. However the sequels for the film, â€˜Rambo: First Blood Part IIâ€™ and â€˜Rambo IIIâ€™, were met with much less success.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
In 1982, he continued with his â€˜Rockyâ€™ franchise and came up with â€˜Rocky IIIâ€™, followed by â€˜Rocky IVâ€™, three years later. In order to be able to do full justice to the role, he worked out and embarked on a demanding training program, after which he became an extremely popular fitness symbol.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
In 1987, he decided to break away from his â€˜tough nutâ€™ roles and starred in the film, â€˜Over the Topâ€™, which was a different genre of film. However, the film did not do well at the box-office and was received poorly by critics. Two years later, he once again starred in a different genre of film in â€˜Tango and Cashâ€™, which was successful.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
In 1990, he starred in the fifth installment of the â€˜Rockyâ€™ series titled, â€˜Rocky Vâ€™. The film did poorly at the box office and it was intended to be the last film in the franchise. In the next two years, he tried his hand at comedy but failed miserably in â€˜Oscarâ€™ and â€˜Stop! Or My Mom Will Shootâ€™.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
He starred in the successful film, â€˜Cliffhangerâ€™, which brought back the faith of his fans in his acting abilities. The same year, he starred in the futuristic film, â€˜Demolition Manâ€™.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
From 1994 to 1996, he appeared in a string of hit films including, â€˜The Specialistâ€™, â€˜Judge Dreddâ€™ and â€˜Assassinsâ€™.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
In 1997, he appeared in the low-budget film, â€˜Cop Landâ€™ opposite Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, which was an average hit at the box-office. The next year, he lent his voice for the animated film, â€˜Antzâ€™.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
From 2000 to 2005, he was seen in the films, â€˜Get Carterâ€™, â€˜Drivenâ€™, â€˜Avenging Angelâ€™, â€˜D-Toxâ€™, â€˜Spy Kids 3-D: Game Overâ€™, â€˜Taxi 3â€™ and â€˜Shadeâ€™. In 2005, he was also the co-presenter for the boxing series, â€˜The Contenderâ€™.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">He took a break in 2005 and served as the host and mentor to contenders participating in the reality show, â€˜The Contenderâ€™.</li>
     <li data-aos="fade-right">
After a break from films, he made a comeback in Hollywood with the sixth Rocky instalment, â€˜Rocky Balboaâ€™, which became a critical sleeper hit, in 2006. Two years later, he released the fourth instalment of the â€˜Ramboâ€™ series, simply titled as â€˜Ramboâ€™. This movie also became equally successful.</li>
